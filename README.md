# Crew

A from-scratch, native **GPU terminal** written in Rust — an AI-oriented terminal
where everything renders as tiles (no overlays). Panes auto-tile into a
near-square grid, drawn cell-by-cell on the GPU with `winit` + `wgpu` +
`glyphon`. See [docs/CREW.md](docs/CREW.md) for the full guide.

It also ships a built-in **swarm orchestration engine** (`crew-hive`): give it a
goal and it decomposes the work into a task graph and runs a pool of agents
toward it — single-goal decomposition or parallel-job batches, bring-your-own-LLM
per agent, with a live constellation/heatmap view. See
[Swarm orchestration](#swarm-orchestration-crew-hive) and
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

Built on **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows**.

## Install

### Quick install (macOS / Linux)

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishtyagi10/crew/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs the prebuilt `crew` binary to `~/.local/bin`. Set `INSTALL_DIR` to
choose another location.

### With cargo (any platform with Rust)

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/ashishtyagi10/crew crew-app
```

### From GitHub Releases (standalone package)

Download the latest archive for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ashishtyagi10/crew/releases), extract it, and move the `crew` binary to a directory on your `PATH`.

| Platform | Asset |
|----------|-------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `crew-v*-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` |
| macOS (Intel) | `crew-v*-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` |
| Linux (x86_64) | `crew-v*-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |
| Linux (ARM64) | `crew-v*-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |
| Windows (x86_64) | `crew-v*-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` |

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ashishtyagi10/crew.git
cd crew
cargo build --release -p crew-app
# Binary is at target/release/crew
```

## Updating

How you update depends on how you installed:

- **Quick install (prebuilt binary):** re-run the install one-liner — it always
  fetches the latest release and overwrites the binary in `~/.local/bin`
  (idempotent, no sudo):
  ```sh
  curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishtyagi10/crew/main/install.sh | sh
  ```
- **cargo:** `cargo install --git https://github.com/ashishtyagi10/crew crew-app --force`
- **Source checkout:** `git pull && cargo build --release -p crew-app`.
- **In-app:** the **`/update`** command downloads the latest release binary for
  your platform over the running one. Progress streams into a dedicated **UPDATE
  card in the left nav** (checking → downloading → installed) — no separate shell
  or checkout — then **`/restart`** relaunches Crew into the new build whenever
  you're ready. A standalone `crew --self-update` CLI path remains as a headless
  fallback.

The prebuilt path only sees a version once its release assets are published.

## Run

```sh
cargo run --release -p crew-app
```

### Detached mode

Launched from a terminal, `crew` shares that terminal's session — so closing the
terminal sends it `SIGHUP` and the window dies with it. Start it **detached** to
keep it running after the launching terminal closes:

```sh
crew --detach   # or: crew -d
```

This re-launches crew in a new session (no controlling terminal) and returns your
prompt immediately. (Equivalent to `setsid crew` / `nohup crew &` if you prefer
the shell built-ins.)

## Panes

Panes auto-tile into a near-square grid. Each pane has a title bar showing its
index, the program-set title (often the cwd), and right-aligned status glyphs
(`⇡N` scrollback, `●` new output, `!` bell, `»` broadcast input). The focused
pane has a near-white border and a bright block cursor.

Crew displays up to **6 panes as full tiles**. Additional panes are demoted to a
minimized thumbnail strip along the bottom of the content area, ordered
least-recently-active first. Click a thumbnail, use the sidebar, or press
**Cmd+1 … 9** to focus a pane and restore it to the full grid.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Press **`/keys`** in the input bar for the full list in-app.

| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Next / previous pane | **Ctrl+Tab** / **Ctrl+Shift+Tab** (also Cmd+] / Cmd+[) |
| Jump to pane N | **Cmd+1 … 9** |
| Jump to next active pane | **Cmd+A** |
| Move pane left / right | **Cmd+{** / **Cmd+}** |
| Focus the input bar | **Cmd+I** |
| New shell pane | **Cmd+T** |
| Settings / chat pane | **Cmd+,** / **Cmd+J** |
| Toggle sidebar | **Cmd+G** |
| Zoom focused pane | **Cmd+Z** (or double-click) |
| Broadcast input to all panes | **Cmd+S** |
| Font bigger / smaller / reset | **Cmd+=** / **Cmd+-** / **Cmd+0** |
| Copy visible screen / paste | **Cmd+C** / **Cmd+V** (Cmd+V pastes a clipboard image as a temp PNG path) |
| Insert a newline in a terminal | **Shift+Enter** (sends a line feed, not submit) |
| Close pane / maximize window | **Cmd+W** / **Cmd+M** |
| Clear focused pane scrollback | **Cmd+K** (or `/clear`) |
| Scroll any pane | **Shift+PageUp** / **Shift+PageDown** (Shift+Home/End for top/bottom), or mouse wheel — in a full-screen app (vim/less/agent TUI) the wheel is forwarded to the program |
| Quit | **Cmd+Q** (press twice to confirm when panes are open) |

## Input bar

The docked command bar supports slash commands (type `/` for a palette:
`/shell`, `/crew`, `/swarm`, `/goal <text>`, `/batch <file>`, `/run <cmd>`, `/edit <file>`, `/settings`, `/find <text>`, `/name <text>`, `/clear`, `/only`, `/copy`, `/dump`, `/open`,
`/clearall`, `/closeall`, `/pwd`, `/about`, `/font`, `/theme`, `/restart`, `/update`, `/broadcast`, `/zoom`, `/sidebar`, `/keys`, `/far`, `/exit`), fish-style autosuggest from history, `cd`
completion with `$VAR` expansion, and `Up`/`Down` history recall persisted to
`$XDG_CONFIG/crew/history`. Anything that isn't a slash command or `cd` is sent
to the focused terminal.

## Sidebar

A docked left panel (toggle with **Cmd+G**) with a live clock, CPU/MEM/DISK
gauges, a moving **CPU sparkline** under them, load average, host info, network
rates with a **throughput sparkline**, a git section for the working directory,
and a list of open panes (click a row to focus it). The sparklines scroll on the
sidebar's once-a-second refresh, so the charts animate at no extra redraw cost.

## Multi-agent panes (`/crew`)

`/crew` opens a pane that lets independent CLI coding agents — **claude**,
**codex**, and **opencode** — message each other to work a task. On open, the
pane probes which agent CLIs are installed and lists the ones it found (missing
ones are skipped). Type a task and press Enter; prefix `@<agent>` to choose who
starts (otherwise the first detected agent does).

Each agent gets a clean message plus the task and a transcript so far, and ends
its reply with a control line: **`@next <agent>`** to hand off to a peer, or
**`@done`** to end the thread (the parser tolerates markdown wrappers and
re-asks once if the line is missing). The broker logs every hop as `from → to`
with the reply, so the whole conversation is visible in the pane. A hop counter
caps each thread (default 6), an optional token budget caps spend, and every
agent call has a timeout — a hung agent is killed and logged, never blocking the
UI.

The pane speaks a small **construct language**: `/fan <task>` sends one task to
every agent **in parallel** (replies stream back fastest-first), `@a+b <task>`
fans out to a subset, `/loop <n> <task>` iterates on the crew's own answer,
`/goal <text>` keeps working until a judge agent rules the goal met, `/model
<agent> <model>` pins agents to **different models side by side**, `/status`
reports live totals, and `/stop` cancels the running construct — with Tab
completion for `@agents` and `/constructs` in the composer.

The pane itself reads like a multi-agent console: a header with a live status
(`| coder · 12s` while an agent thinks, `| 3 working · 8s` during a parallel
fan, a running `~N tok` meter, connection dot), an **agent roster row** — one
colored chip per agent with its model badge, every active agent highlighted —
and **message cards** (`▍sender · 2m ago · 4.2s`)
that colour each agent consistently and show hand-offs as `from → to`. Every
turn ends with a timeline log line: `turn done — planner 4.2s → coder 8.1s ·
2 exchange(s) · ~950 tok (approx)`. Fenced ```code``` in replies renders as a
bordered card with a language tag on a dimmed background; a composer with
`@agent` chips and key hints frames the input (a valid `@mention` lights up in
the agent's colour); a proportional scrollbar plus a `↓ N new` pill keep long
transcripts navigable; and a fresh pane opens with onboarding — the detected
crew, roles, and an example prompt.

Agents run headlessly off the render thread (in a broker subprocess), so the
window stays responsive. **Adding a fourth agent takes one adapter**: add a
constructor in `crates/crew-plugin/src/broker/agents.rs` and register it in
`known_adapters` — the routing engine is untouched. See
[docs/CREW.md](docs/CREW.md) for the protocol and architecture.

## Swarm orchestration (`crew-hive`)

Beyond the `/crew` relay (a few CLI agents talking turn-by-turn), Crew includes a
full orchestration **engine**, the `crew-hive` crate — the substrate for running
*many* agents toward one goal:

- **Planner** — decomposes a goal into a task-graph (a dependency DAG). Ships a
  deterministic `StubPlanner` and an `LlmPlanner` that asks an LLM for the graph.
- **Scheduler** — a `tokio` DAG executor with a bounded worker pool (concurrency
  cap), dependency fan-in/fan-out, failure cascade-cancel, panic-as-failure
  resilience, and cooperative cancellation.
- **Agents** — a uniform `Agent` trait with three workers: `StubAgent` (tests),
  `ApiAgent` (a native LLM call — just a future, no PTY, so thousands can run),
  and `RemoteAgent` (dispatched over a wire to an out-of-process worker or an
  external engine such as LangGraph).
- **Blackboard** — agents read their dependencies' results and write their own,
  merging work upward (replacing fragile file/sentinel passing).
- **Bring-your-own-LLM** — a `Provider` abstraction (mock + an Anthropic client),
  with per-agent `ModelTier` cost tiering (haiku / sonnet / opus).
- **Two modes, one engine** — single-goal decomposition *and* flat parallel-job
  batches (`batch_graph`); a `budget_governor` enforces a hard cost ceiling.
- **Swarm view** — a constellation/heatmap layout over live fleet telemetry
  (color = state, mode auto-switches to a heatmap past ~150 agents).

The engine is wired into the app through three commands, each opening a live
**swarm pane** that renders the constellation + a fleet HUD (live / done / failed
/ cost) and updates every frame:

- **`/swarm`** — runs a built-in fan-out/merge demo graph with stub agents
  (no API key, no network) — the quickest way to see the swarm view.
- **`/goal <text>`** — plans the goal into a task-graph off the UI thread, then
  runs it. With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set it uses the real `LlmPlanner` + native
  `ApiAgent` workers (each task billed at the planner's per-task `ModelTier`);
  without a key it falls back to the deterministic stub backend so the full
  flow still works offline.
- **`/batch <file>`** — runs a file of jobs (one per line) as a flat, all-parallel
  swarm — the "many parallel jobs" mode.

Real-LLM `/goal` and `/batch` runs are capped by the `budget_governor` (default
$1.00); the pane shows a "budget exceeded — swarm cancelled" notice if the cap
trips. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-crew-agent-swarm-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-crew-agent-swarm-design.md).

## Settings

`/settings` opens a scrollable form covering every configurable property: font
family/size, sidebar, theme, accent, paper texture + grain, launch-maximized,
and the whole notification block (master + per-event toggles, min-secs
threshold, watched output patterns). Settings persist to
`$XDG_CONFIG/crew/config.toml` and apply live on Save. The config file also
accepts `accent = "#rrggbb"` to override Crew's accent; omit it (or give an
invalid value) to use the active theme's default accent. It applies at launch —
`/restart` picks up edits made outside the `/settings` pane.

**Themes.** Crew ships five themes: two paper/e-ink looks — `paper-dark`
(default — a high-contrast "newspaper" look) and `paper-light` (a warm paper
page) — and three old-school **CRT phosphor** themes: `crt-green` (classic P1),
`crt-amber` (P3), and `crt-blue`, each a monochrome glow on a near-black tube.
Switch with `/theme <name>` or cycle through all of them live with
`Ctrl+Shift+L`; the choice persists. A subtle GPU grain + vignette sits behind
everything (it reads as a CRT glow on the phosphor themes). Config keys:
`theme = "paper-dark"`, `paper_texture = true` (grain on/off),
`paper_grain = 1.3` (strength `0.0`–`2.0`). See
[docs/CREW.md](docs/CREW.md#themes).

## Architecture

Crew is a Cargo workspace with five crates:

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `crew-app` | Window, panes, input, in-pane UI |
| `crew-render` | GPU rendering (`wgpu` + `glyphon`) |
| `crew-term` | PTY + terminal grid (`alacritty_terminal` + `portable-pty`) |
| `crew-plugin` | Chat / agent plugins (the `/crew` relay broker) |
| `crew-hive` | Swarm orchestration engine (planner, scheduler, agents, blackboard, telemetry) |

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full diagram (app +
engine internals).

Hard rules: every `.rs` file stays ≤200 lines; `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets` is warning-free.
