//! A live swarm pane. Two entry points:
//!
//! - `/swarm` → [`SwarmPane::demo`] runs a fixed fan-out/merge graph immediately.
//! - `/goal <text>` → [`SwarmPane::for_goal`] first plans the goal into a graph
//!   off the UI thread (via [`plan_goal`]), shows a "planning…" banner, then runs
//!   the resulting graph and visualises it.
//!
//! `/goal` adapts to its environment: when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set it plans
//! with [`LlmPlanner`] and executes with real [`ApiFactory`] agents; otherwise
//! it falls back to a deterministic [`StubPlanner`] + always-succeeding stub
//! agents so the whole goal → plan → schedule → bridge → view pipeline still
//! runs live, offline, and deterministically. `/swarm` always uses the stub path.
