//! A live swarm pane. Two entry points:
//!
//! - `/swarm` → [`SwarmPane::demo`] runs a fixed fan-out/merge graph immediately.
//! - `/goal <text>` → [`SwarmPane::for_goal`] first plans the goal into a graph
//!   off the UI thread (via [`plan_goal`]), shows a "planning…" banner, then runs
//!   the resulting graph and visualises it.
//!
//! Both execute with always-succeeding stub agents — no API keys, no network —
//! so the whole goal → plan → schedule → bridge → view pipeline runs live and
//! deterministically. Planning currently uses the deterministic [`StubPlanner`];
//! swapping in `LlmPlanner` (real goal decomposition) is the next step once the
//! app grows provider/API-key config.
