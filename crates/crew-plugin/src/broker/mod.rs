//! Multi-agent broker: routes messages between coding agents. By default these
//! are the inbuilt API agents (planner/coder/reviewer in `apiadapter`), which
//! call the LLM in-process via crew-hive; the external-CLI adapters in `agents`
//! remain available as the same [`Adapter`] abstraction. The broker is
//! agent-agnostic — an adapter turns an envelope body into a clean reply string;
//! nothing in the routing engine cares how that reply was produced.
//!
//! Every message in flight is an [`Envelope`]. An adapter turns an envelope
//! body into a clean reply string (never raw CLI chatter). The [`engine::Broker`]
//! drives the relay: it calls the addressed agent, parses the reply for a
//! routing directive (`TO <peer>:` / `DONE`), logs every hop, and stops at the
//! hop limit so a thread can never loop forever.
